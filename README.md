## How to install the app


### Downloading the project code and loading it with intellij

You need to get the code locally for the git project repo. For this, you need to

- Fork the project
- Clone your fork (if it's your first development with GIT, we recommend putting all the git repo in ~/Development/GIT)
- Download the latest intellij version (ultimate)
- Open the project with intellij (you will need to open it as an existing maven project)

Note. You'll need to unregister your TPP to run the tests if it's already registered.

### Setup the google chrome driver

Our functional tests use Selenium, which requires a google chrome driver to run.
This would need to be installed in your OS system first.
